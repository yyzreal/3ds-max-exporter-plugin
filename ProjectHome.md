This project was developed with 3DS Max 9 SDK in C++, Visual Studio 2005. This exporter plug-in is aimed to export 3D mesh data from 3DS Max into a predefined file format. These mesh data includes vertices, texture, normals, skeletal animation, etc.

The project was kinda old and becoming a legacy. I developed it in 2009, but never have any update since that. Recently, I am more and more realizing the importance of being open source. So this is why after such a long time I decided to upload it onto Google Code.

I uploaded all the related docs and source code here, for anyone in need. And I would feel extremely flattered if anyone thinks it helpful.
